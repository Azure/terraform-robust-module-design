# Robust Terraform module design

This repository shows design patterns that I have found useful when writing Terraform modules.
The patterns are not specific to any particular cloud provider, but the examples are written for Azure.
The patterns are sometimes not the most efficient or beautiful way of doing things, but instead have been created with robustness in mind.
