# Conditional resource or module instance

- [back home](../)

This pattern shows how to create **either zero or one** resource or module instance, based on a variable.

This is a very common pattern, typically using the `count` meta-argument.

We have two examples:

- [Conditional resource creation using count](./conditional_resource_creation_count/)
- [Conditional resource creation using for_each](./conditional_resource_creation_for_each/)
