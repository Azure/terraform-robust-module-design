# Looping

Looping is typically used in three scenarios in Terraform:

1. When you want to create zero or more instances of a resource or module.
1. When you want to create multiple blocks within a resource.

We also use loops to conditionally create zero or one resource/module call.
I have placed these in the conditional resources section.
